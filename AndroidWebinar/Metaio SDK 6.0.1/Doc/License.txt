6- Support, Updates and Upgrades

a- In the sole discretion of METAIO, metaio SDK Customers who have a Right to Use, a Right to Deploy or who have bought the metaio SDK Basic or Pro Deployment option, may receive Updates and/or Support for the use of the Licensed Software or deployment of the Derivative Works. Support, for metaio SDK Customers, will only be provided through METAIO’s website (www.metaio.com) and/or Forum.  

b- Under this Agreement, Customer will not receive any Upgrades of the Licensed Software from METAIO.


   7- Disclaimer of Warranties.
	
a- METAIO warrants that the Licensed Software is free from material defects at the time of delivery. Material defects are deviations from the product specification, including in the accompanying documentation, where such deviations significantly impair the value of the software or its fitness for ordinary use as described in the documentation. The Customer shall immediately notify METAIO in writing of any material defect that may occur, specifying how the material defect manifests itself, what effect it has, under what circumstances it occurs, and how it is to be classified from the Customer's point of view. Otherwise METAIO shall not be liable for the material defect.

b- Provided that METAIO, having received notification of the material defect, has established that a material defect actually exists, it will, at its option, remedy such material defect (subsequent improvement or subsequent delivery) within a reasonable period of time. If an attempt to remedy the material defect is not successful within this period of time, and if such an attempt also fails within a further reasonable time limit to be set by the Customer, and if, furthermore, METAIO does not provide an interim solution, then the Customer can reduce (lower) the license fee or cancel the Agreement. Nothing of the aforesaid shall prejudice any claim for damages of the Customer. If any notified material defect cannot be ascribed to METAIO, then the Customer shall compensate METAIO for the time spent, as well as for the accrued costs (in particular travel expenses), in each case at the applicable rate. 

c- METAIO is entitled to bypass any material defect that may arise with an interim solution if the material defect itself can only be remedied at unreasonable expense, and if the run time and response time of the licensed software are not seriously impaired as a result of the interim solution. 

d- METAIO is not obligated to warrant if modifications have been made to the Licensed Software unless the Customer provides evidence that the modifications are in no way connected with the defect that has occurred and that such modifications do not significantly hinder analysis and remedying of the defect. 

e- Claims of defects are statute barred within 12 months following the delivery of the Licensed Software. This does not apply if the corresponding defect has been maliciously concealed. Acquisition of further rights of use for licensed software already installed does not reset the period of limitation.

f- EXCEPT FOR THE FOREGOING LIMITED WARRANTIES IN THIS SECTION 7, METAIO MAKES NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY METAIO OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES SHALL CREATE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY.


8- Overall Liability 

a- METAIO shall be fully liable for damage caused intentionally or by gross negligence, if a defect has been maliciously concealed, if a specific condition has been guaranteed and for damages based on the Product Liability Act (“Produkthaftungsgesetz”).

b- METAIO will only be liable for other damage if an obligation has been violated by simple negligence, compliance with which is of particular importance in order to achieve the purpose of the Agreement, and if the damage caused hereby is both typical and foreseeable based on the contractually agreed use of the Licensed Software. In such a case, the liability is restricted to an amount twice that of the license fees paid under the terms of this Agreement.

c- In the event of initial impossibility of performance METAIO shall be liable only if it had knowledge of the impediment to performance, or if its lack of knowledge is due to gross negligence.  

d- METAIO is only liable for the recovery of data provided that Customer has, appropriate to the level of risk, made regular backup copies, and ensured that the data from such backup copies can be reconstructed at reasonable expense. Any further liability for loss of data is excluded.

e- In no event, shall METAIO under this Agreement be liable for injury or damage to business, lost profits, revenues or goodwill of any party hereto, or for any special, consequential, or incidental damages, whether for breach of warranty, breach of contract, repudiation of contract, termination, negligence, or otherwise, even if it shall have been advised of the possibility of such damages, excepting, however, any damages or other cost, expense or liability arising from a breach of confidentiality, personal injury, property damage, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.

f- The above regulations shall also apply in favor of the employees and vicarious agents of METAIO.

g- With the exception of claims based on tortious acts, Customer’s claims for damages, liability for which is limited in accordance with the above provision, become statute-barred within one year of the start of the statutory limitation period.

h- This section states the entire liability of METAIO. In no event, shall METAIO be liable for any direct or indirect damage other than those stated in this Sections 8.
	

9- Indemnity.  

Customer agrees to indemnify and hold METAIO, its subsidiaries and affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors and employees harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, causes of action, losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses, incurred or otherwise suffered by METAIO (including but not limited to costs of defense, investigation and reasonable attorney’s fees) arising out of, resulting from or in connection with (i) any use, reproduction or distribution of the Derivative Works, which causes an infringement of any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other Intellectual Property, publicity or privacy right of any third parties arising in any jurisdiction anywhere in the world, (ii) the download, distribution, installation, storage, execution, use or transfer of Derivative Works, related content or materials, by any person or entity except and solely to the extent such infringement is caused by the unmodified Licensed Software, or portions thereof, as supplied to Customer by METAIO under this Agreement, and/or (iii) any breach of this Agreement by Customer. If and as requested by METAIO, Customer agrees to defend METAIO in connection with any third party claims, demands, or causes of action resulting from, arising out of or in connection with any of the foregoing.


10- Confidentiality 

a- Both parties agree that the Licensed Software contains Confidential Information pertinent to METAIO. Customer undertakes to protect from disclosure to any third party the Licensed Software - including all accompanying documentation, any backup copies made, and all other information of METAIO identified or marked as Confidential and which is made accessible to Customer within the context of this Agreement. Customer shall not disclose, or permit the disclosure of, the Licensed Software and/or documentation in any form or any information relating to the Licensed Software and/or documentation to any third party without METAIO’s prior written permission. Customer acknowledges that the unauthorized use or disclosure of the METAIO’s Confidential Information would cause METAIO to incur irreparable harm and significant damages, the degree of which may be difficult to ascertain.  Accordingly, Customer agrees that METAIO will have the right to obtain immediate equitable relief to enjoin any unauthorized use or disclosure of its Confidential Information, in addition to any other rights and remedies that it may have at law or otherwise.

b- The Confidential Information will not include information that: (i) is now or thereafter becomes generally known or available to the public, through no act or omission on the part of Customer, (ii) is expressly revealed by METAIO on a non-confidential basis, (iii) was known by Customer prior to receiving such information, or (iv) is rightfully acquired by Customer from a third party who has the right to disclose it and who provides it without restriction as to use or disclosure. The burden of proof for the existence of any of the above exceptions shall be borne by Customer.


11- Feedback

Customer, at its sole discretion, may report its findings and results of the use of the Licensed Software ("Feedback"). Feedback includes, without limitation, suggestions, comments, ideas or know how about the Licensed Software in direct connection with Customer’s evaluation and use (whether presented orally, in written form or otherwise) and Derivative Works or parts of the Derivative Works in machine readable form or source code. With respect to such Feedback, Customer hereby grants METAIO, under the applicable Intellectual Property Rights owned by Customer, the worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free rights: (1) to use, copy and modify Feedback, to create derivative works and/or include such Feedback in the Licensed Software thereof, (2) to make (and have made), use, import, sell, offer for sale, lease or otherwise distribute any products or services of METAIO containing Feedback, and (3) to sublicense the foregoing rights to the extent a license is necessary for using products or services of METAIO.
 

12- Extinction of Rights

Customer's Right to Use the Licensed Software and Deploy the Derivative Works, with or without Branding Features, becomes extinct, without notice being required, if Customer breaches any of the above terms of the Agreement. In such a case, Customer is obliged, at the discretion of METAIO, to return or destroy the tangible items or embodiments, all copies and documentation. Any such destruction must be confirmed in writing to METAIO. 


13- Waiver

No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of METAIO, any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy prevent any further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. The waiver by METAIO of any breach shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other term of this Agreement.


14- Severability

If any provision of this Agreement shall be held or become invalid, this shall not prejudice the validity of the other provisions of this Agreement. METAIO and Customer agree on replacing the invalid provision with a valid provision, which most closely approximates to the commercial objective of The Parties. The same applies to eventual loopholes in this Agreement. 


15- Audit rights 

a- Upon written request by METAIO, Customer shall, within a period of 15 days following receipt of the request, supply METAIO in writing with all requested information on the type and extent of use, by Customer, of the Licensed Software at the time, which is necessary to examine whether such use complies with the provisions of this License Agreement. 

b- During the term of this Agreement, METAIO is entitled, at its own expense, to have a member of the tax advising or business consulting professions who is sworn to professional secrecy, or any other independent expert, verify whether there has been compliance with the provisions of this License Agreement. The auditor must be granted access to inspect all documents and files deemed definitive for calculating the extent of use of the Licensed Software. If such verification reveals any inaccuracies, then the audit fees shall be borne by Customer, otherwise they will be borne by METAIO.

Such third party software additional terms and conditions, listed and identified in the Master List of TPS Licenses at http://www.metaio.com/licenses/tps-master-list, are part of and incorporated into this Agreement.

d. Customer will not: (i) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, or translate the Licensed Software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the Licensed Software, except if and only to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law; (ii) use the Licensed Software or any part of the Licensed Software, the documentation or Customer’s knowledge of the Licensed Software to create a product with the same or substantially the same functionalities as the Licensed Software, to create or develop any developer tools (including without limitation plug-ins and middleware) or any software other than the Application ; (ii) transfer or assign this Agreement or any of the rights, duties or obligations hereunder; (iii) remove or modify any marks or proprietary notices of METAIO; (iv)except as expressly permitted hereby, rent, lease, loan or otherwise in any manner provide or distribute the Licensed Software and/or documentation or any copy of thereof to any third party.

Customer shall not use the Licensed Software and/or documentation to create, develop or publish any Application that invades, violates or infringes the Intellectual Property rights (copyrights, patent rights, trade secrets, trademark or service mark rights, privacy, publicity, or any other rights) of any person or entity. In addition, Customer agrees not to design, develop or publish any Application with the objective to, damage any computer, network, or any feature or function of a wireless device, computer or network based on the use of such application. Customer represents and warrants that Customer has obtained all necessary permission and licenses from all copyright holders, if any, in material or code used or recorded in any Application that Customer creates or develops with the Licensed Software.

5- METAIO’s Intellectual Property Rights of Branding Features

f. Customer acknowledges the rights, title and interest of METAIO in Branding Features, and agrees not to register any trademark comprised or confusingly similar to any Branding Features in any country. Customer agrees that all use of Branding Features will inure solely to the benefit of METAIO. Modifications of Branding Features performed by Customer are not permitted. 

g. METAIO hereby grants Customer a personal, non-exclusive, worldwide, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-assignable, revocable right to use Branding Features in the Application or Applications. 

h. Customer’s use of Branding Features shall not in any manner indicate, suggest or imply that METAIO is in any manner endorsing, approving, sponsoring or responsible for Customer’s Application(s).


6- Support, Updates and Upgrades

i. At the sole discretion of METAIO, Customers of the Licensed Software may receive Updates and/or support for the use of the Licensed Software or deployment of the Licensed Software. Updates are made available to Customer by METAIO at its sole discretion. Support, for the Licensed Software Customers, will only be provided through METAIO’s website (www.metaio.com) and/or forum.  Premium support may be provided via email or phone, to certain Customers depending on the Commercial Terms of the subscription acquired.

j. At the sole discretion of METAIO, METAIO may make certain internal server updates that affect the full functionality of the Licensed Software. In the event of such internal server update, Customer shall be required to download an Update made available by METAIO in order to restore full functionality of the Licensed Software.

k.  Under this Agreement, Customer may, at the sole discretion of METAIO, receive Upgrades of the Licensed Software from METAIO. 


7- Disclaimer of Warranties.

l. METAIO warrants that the Licensed Software is free from material defects at the time of delivery. Material defects are deviations from the product specification (subject to change from time to time), including in the accompanying documentation, where such deviations significantly impair the value of the software or its fitness for ordinary use as described in the documentation. The Customer shall immediately notify METAIO in writing of any material defect that may occur, specifying how the material defect manifests itself, what effect it has, under what circumstances it occurs, and how it is to be classified from the Customer's point of view. Otherwise METAIO shall not be liable for the material defect.

m. Provided that METAIO, having received notification of the material defect, has established that a material defect actually exists, it will, at its option, remedy such material defect (subsequent improvement or subsequent delivery) within a reasonable period of time. If an attempt to remedy the material defect is not successful within this period of time, and if such an attempt also fails within a further reasonable time limit to be set by the Customer, and if, furthermore, METAIO does not provide an interim solution, then the Customer can reduce (lower) the license fee or cancel the Agreement. Nothing of the aforesaid shall prejudice any claim for damages of the Customer. If any notified material defect cannot be ascribed to METAIO, then the Customer shall compensate METAIO for the time spent, as well as for the accrued costs (in particular travel expenses), in each case at the applicable rate. 

n. METAIO is entitled to bypass any material defect that may arise with an interim solution if the material defect itself can only be remedied at unreasonable expense, and if the run time and response time of the licensed software are not seriously impaired as a result of the interim solution. 

o. METAIO is not obligated to warrant if modifications have been made to the Licensed Software unless the Customer provides evidence that the modifications are in no way connected with the defect that has occurred and that such modifications do not significantly hinder analysis and remedying of the defect. 

p. Claims of defects are statute barred within 12 months following the delivery of the Licensed Software. This does not apply if the corresponding defect has been maliciously concealed. Acquisition of further rights of use for licensed software already installed does not reset the period of limitation.

q. EXCEPT FOR THE FOREGOING LIMITED WARRANTIES IN THIS SECTION 7, METAIO MAKES NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY METAIO OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES SHALL CREATE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY.

8- Overall Liability

r. METAIO shall be fully liable for damage caused intentionally or by gross negligence, if a defect has been maliciously concealed, if a specific condition has been guaranteed and for damages based on the Product Liability Act (“Produkthaftungsgesetz”).

s. METAIO will only be liable for other damage if an obligation has been violated by simple negligence, compliance with which is of particular importance in order to achieve the purpose of the Agreement, and if the damage caused hereby is both typical and foreseeable based on the contractually agreed use of the Licensed Software. In such a case, the liability is restricted to an amount twice that of the license fees paid under the terms of this Agreement.

t. In the event of initial impossibility of performance METAIO shall be liable only if it had knowledge of the impediment to performance, or if its lack of knowledge is due to gross negligence.  

u. METAIO is only liable for the recovery of data provided that Customer has, appropriate to the level of risk, made regular backup copies, and ensured that the data from such backup copies can be reconstructed at reasonable expense. Any further liability for loss of data is excluded.

v. In no event, shall METAIO under this Agreement be liable for injury or damage to business, lost profits, revenues or goodwill of any party hereto, or for any special, consequential, or incidental damages, whether for breach of warranty, breach of contract, repudiation of contract, termination, negligence, or otherwise, even if it shall have been advised of the possibility of such damages, excepting, however, any damages or other cost, expense or liability arising from a breach of confidentiality, personal injury, property damage, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.

w. The above regulations shall also apply in favor of the employees and vicarious agents of METAIO.

x. With the exception of claims based on tortious acts, Customer’s claims for damages, liability for which is limited in accordance with the above provision, become statute-barred within one year of the start of the statutory limitation period.
	

9- Indemnity.  

Customer agrees to indemnify and hold METAIO, its subsidiaries and affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors and employees harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, causes of action, losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses, incurred or otherwise suffered by METAIO (including but not limited to costs of defense, investigation and reasonable attorney’s fees) arising out of, resulting from or in connection with (i) any use, reproduction or distribution of the Application, which causes an infringement of any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other Intellectual Property, publicity or privacy right of any third parties arising in any jurisdiction anywhere in the world, (ii) the download, distribution, installation, storage, execution, use or transfer of the Application, related content or materials, by any person or entity except and solely to the extent such infringement is caused by the unmodified Licensed Software, or portions thereof, as supplied to Customer by METAIO under this Agreement, and/or (iii) any breach of this Agreement by Customer. If and as requested by METAIO, Customer agrees to defend METAIO in connection with any third party claims, demands, or causes of action resulting from, arising out of or in connection with any of the foregoing.


10- Confidentiality 

a- Both parties agree that the Licensed Software contains Confidential Information pertinent to METAIO. Customer undertakes to protect from disclosure to any third party the Licensed Software - including all accompanying documentation, any backup copies made, and all other information of METAIO identified or marked as Confidential and which is made accessible to Customer within the context of this Agreement. Customer shall not disclose, or permit the disclosure of, the Licensed Software and/or documentation in any form or any information relating to the Licensed Software and/or documentation to any third party without METAIO’s prior written permission. Customer acknowledges that the unauthorized use or disclosure of the METAIO’s Confidential Information would cause METAIO to incur irreparable harm and significant damages, the degree of which may be difficult to ascertain.  Accordingly, Customer agrees that METAIO will have the right to obtain immediate equitable relief to enjoin any unauthorized use or disclosure of its Confidential Information, in addition to any other rights and remedies that it may have at law or otherwise.

b- The Confidential Information will not include information that: (i) is now or thereafter becomes generally known or available to the public, through no act or omission on the part of Customer, (ii) is expressly revealed by METAIO on a non-confidential basis, (iii) was known by Customer prior to receiving such information, or (iv) is rightfully acquired by Customer from a third party who has the right to disclose it and who provides it without restriction as to use or disclosure. The burden of proof for the existence of any of the above exceptions shall be borne by Customer.


11- Feedback

Customer, at its sole discretion, may report its findings and results of the use of the Licensed Software ("Feedback"). Feedback includes, without limitation, suggestions, comments, ideas or know how about the Licensed Software in direct connection with Customer’s use (whether presented orally, in written form or otherwise) and Application or parts of the Application in machine readable form or source code. With respect to such Feedback, Customer hereby grants METAIO, under the applicable Intellectual Property Rights owned by Customer, the worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free rights: (1) to use, copy and modify Feedback, to create derivative works and/or include such Feedback in the Licensed Software thereof, (2) to make (and have made), use, import, sell, offer for sale, lease or otherwise distribute any products or services of METAIO containing Feedback, and (3) to sublicense the foregoing rights to the extent a license is necessary for using products or services of METAIO.
 

12- Extinction of Rights

Customer's Right to Use and License to Deploy the Licensed Software become extinct, without notice being required, if Customer breaches any of the above terms of the Agreement. In such a case, Customer is obliged, at the discretion of METAIO, to return or destroy the tangible items or embodiments, all copies and documentation. Any such destruction must be confirmed in writing to METAIO. 


13- Waiver

No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of METAIO, any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy prevent any further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. The waiver by METAIO of any breach shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other term of this Agreement.


14- Severability

If any provision of this Agreement shall be held or become invalid, this shall not prejudice the validity of the other provisions of this Agreement. METAIO and Customer agree on replacing the invalid provision with a valid provision, which most closely approximates to the commercial objective of The Parties. The same applies to eventual loopholes in this Agreement. 


15- Audit rights 

a- Upon written request by METAIO, Customer shall, within a period of 15 days following receipt of the request, supply METAIO in writing with all requested information on the type and extent of use, by Customer, of the Licensed Software at the time, which is necessary to examine whether such use complies with the provisions of this License Agreement. 

b- During the term of this Agreement, METAIO is entitled, at its own expense, to have a member of the tax advising or business consulting professions who is sworn to professional secrecy, or any other independent expert, verify whether there has been compliance with the provisions of this License Agreement. The auditor must be granted access to inspect all documents and files deemed definitive for calculating the extent of use of the Licensed Software. If such verification reveals any inaccuracies, then the audit fees shall be borne by Customer, otherwise they will be borne by METAIO.


16- Third Party Software

The Licensed Software may use or be integrated by third party software, which requires additional terms and conditions.  Such third party software additional terms and conditions, listed and identified in the Master List of TPS Licenses at http://www.metaio.com/licenses/tps-master-list, are part of and incorporated into this Agreement. By accepting this Agreement, Customer is also accepting the additional terms and conditions set forth herein. METAIO will not warranty, indemnify or otherwise be held liable for any third party software.

17- Final provisions 

a- Any modification or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing to become effective. Verbal ancillary agreements are deemed not to exist.
